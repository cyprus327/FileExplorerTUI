# Elderberry

This is a repo for a project that I originally made as a test for a TUI. After getting a little carried away, it is now also a fairly functional keyboard-controlled file explorer.

## Controls
- F to search the current directory, auto moves the cursor to any found result
- W to move the cursor up
- S to move the cursor down
- A to go back one directory
- D to either move into the currently selected directory or run the selected file (if it's an executable)
- U to undo
- Tab to switch between the sidebar and files
